# SQL
Byte uses PostgreSQL as its main database. In this directory you can find all the sql scripts that generate Byte's db schema. This folder is a [Datagrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/es-es/datagrip/) project. The Datagrip project contains a configuration named `all`which will run all the sql scripts in order and generate the full schema. Optionally you can generate the full sql script by running the JavaScript file which will read the DataGrip config and combine all sql scripts.
